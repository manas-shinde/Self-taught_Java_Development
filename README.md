When learning advanced programming topics such as Dependency Injection( using  Google Guice ), Generics, Collections, and File Handling, it's important to get hands-on experience with practical implementation. Using tools like Eclipse and other IDEs, you can practice implementing these concepts in your code. 

For example, you can create classes that use Dependency Injection to decouple their dependencies, or you can use Generics to create reusable data structures that can work with multiple types of objects. Additionally, you can practice working with Collections to manipulate and store data in your programs, and use File Handling to read and write data to and from files. By practicing these topics in a real-world context, you can gain a deeper understanding of how they work and how to apply them in your own projects.

To implement that I mostly created a CLI application : AddressBook.

  - To check Dependency Injection implementation you can visit branch -> [Dependency-Injection](https://github.com/manas-shinde/Self-taught_Java_Development/tree/Dependency-Injection)

  - For  Generics branch -> [ generics ](https://github.com/manas-shinde/Self-taught_Java_Development/tree/Generics)

  - For File Handling branch -> [file handling ](https://github.com/manas-shinde/Self-taught_Java_Development/tree/file-handling)
